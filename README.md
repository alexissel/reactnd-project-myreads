# MyReads
A [React.js](https://reactjs.org) bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/alexissel/reactnd-project-myreads.git myreads
```

2. Install all project dependencies
```
npm install /or/ yarn install
```

3. Start the development server
```
npm start /or/ yarn start
```

**Note**: A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
